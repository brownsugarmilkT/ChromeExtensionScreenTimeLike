This is my first personal project, apart from schoolwork. While developing this, I enhanced my HTML and CSS Skills while also learning a bit of JavaScript.

I will continue to make changes to it as a lot of things do not work as intended however I am sure I will reach the result I want.

About ChromeExtensionScreenTimeLike: 

Despite the weird name, it was heavily inspired by ScreenTime on ios. I work a lot on my laptop and pc and I am very easily distracted. To battle this, I decided to 
create a chrome extension which when enabled, starts a timer and blocks the listed websites in manifest file. The timer can be changed and when the timer ends, there would
be a sound cue. 

# For some reason, chrome extension won't let me play sounds on chrome.
